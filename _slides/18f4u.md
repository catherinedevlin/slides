Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:14 PM]
1. federalist is the easiest way to get a website up and going within the federal government

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:14 PM]
what it actually is is a few different smaller pieces

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:14 PM]1:14
so we have regular “jekyll hosting” where we just push jekyll sites to S3

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:15 PM]
but we do that whenever there is a change to the repo, because we set up webhooks

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:15 PM]
so its like continuous deployment for jekyll

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:15 PM]
it also has an editor that allows you to edit your content without knowing git, github, markdown, jekyll, s3, or really anything

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:15 PM]
which leads me to poitn 2

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:16 PM]
federalist comes with a few templates you can use if you don’t already have a site

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:16 PM]
those templates can sometimes use the design standards

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:17 PM]
so our best looking one is called the modern team template

Jeremia Kimelman (NYC) [1:17 PM]
and that does use the WDS
