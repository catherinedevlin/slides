# Open Source Society

## Catherine Devlin

[bit.ly/pyohio2015keynote](http://bit.ly/pyohio2015keynote)

---

# Not the topic 

The society of open source

<!-- Not the traditional talk about how open source works -->

<!-- or how it makes money -->

<!-- what crazy anarchists!  What sorcery? -->

---

# Topic 

Open source impact on society:

- It will change the world.

- Not through software.

---

# I am FOSS

- Accidental programmer & DBA
- `ipython-sql`
- FOSS society fan: PyOhio 2008
- Public employee: 18F 

---

# You are FOSS

- Write code
- Implement
- Popularize
- Document 
- Adapt
- Teach
- Bug reports

---

# Status report

# Scale

<!-- Human cooperation enables most of this improvement. -->

<!-- But we're not built to cooperate at this scale. -->

---

## [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)

### ~150

---

## Technology of cooperation

- Hierarchy
- Regulations
- Marketplace

---

# Hierarchy

> Enlil-bani, wondrous king among the princes!  Created by An, 
elevated by Enlil, like Uti the light of all lands, 
born to princedom, girded with all the divine powers, 
watched over by Enlil and listened to by Ninlil
on account of the widespread people living at the 
boundary of heaven and earth!

<!-- King of Sumeria, ~ 1800 BC -->

---

# Law

- Hammurabi
- Solon
- Numa 
- Alfred
- Hiawatha
- Quetzalcoatl

---

# Marketplace 

<!-- Every public good is in danger of sacrifice -->

---

Governments, Corporations, NGOs, ...

They work, BUT

---

> [O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

> - H. P. Lovecraft, "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath", in At The Mountains of Madness

# Revolutions

* Agricultural
* Industrial
* Information

# Changes to 

* More industries
* Society's structure
* Mind

<!-- Supernatural: wild, to great cultivator, to a machine -->

---

# Scaling cooperation

<!-- back to the first problem -->

<!-- Cooperative technologies developed with revolutions -->

<!-- Took centuries -->

<!-- Don't know the results, but excited about prospects -->

# 130,000 Packages

<!-- Python: 20,000 package contributors-->

<!-- big company -->

<!-- teaching, document, popularize, bug reports -->

<!-- without: hierarchy, law, marketplace -->

<!-- centuries of patent law have made this seem natural -->

---

# Credibility

<!-- Trust me - it's secret, thus valuable -->

---

# Openness

- Trust 
- Credentials
- Cooperation

<!-- In the end, chemistry is more credible than alchemy. -->

FOSS will change the world.

Software will be the least important
part of this change.
