---

# Not the topic

The society of open source

Note:
what crazy anarchists!  What sorcery?

---

# Topic

Open source impact on society:

- It will change the world.

- Not through software.

---

# I am FOSS

- Accidental programmer & DBA
- `ipython-sql`
- FOSS society fan: PyOhio 2008
- Public employee: 18F

# You are FOSS

- Write code
- Implement
- Popularize
- Document
- Adapt
- Teach
- Bug reports

# Scale

Note:
We think technology, but even technology comes from SCALE.
We are social animals.  Wired to cooperate.
Hardly any of us could survive a month alone,
but together, pyramids and reusable rockets.

---

## [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)

### ~150

Note:
Trouble is, our built-in cooperation has a limit.

---

## Technology of cooperation

- Hierarchy
- Regulations
- Marketplace

---

# Hierarchy

> Enlil-bani, wondrous king among the princes!  Created by An,
elevated by Enlil, like Uti the light of all lands,
born to princedom, girded with all the divine powers,
watched over by Enlil and listened to by Ninlil
on account of the widespread people living at the
boundary of heaven and earth!

Note:
King of Sumeria, ~ 1800 BC

---

# Law

- Hammurabi
- Solon
- Numa
- Alfred
- Hiawatha
- Quetzalcoatl

---

# Marketplace

![People praying at bull statue](../bullprayer2.jpg)

Note:

Governments, Corporations, NGOs, ...

They work, BUT

---

> [O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

> - H. P. Lovecraft, "The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath", in At The Mountains of Madness

Note:
We feel that our intelligence and goodwill are hampered, not enhanced

... which is odd, because
<!-- We feel that they do not empower human intelligence, but hamstring it -->

---

![Branches of U.S. Government](https://gsa-cmp-fileupload.s3.amazonaws.com/USA_Government_Branches_Infographic.png)

Note:
Attitudes toward government as if it were a foreign occupier

With all this discontent, how can we have a positive revolution?

---

# Revolutions

* Agricultural
* Industrial
* Information

Note:
It's a revolutionary time!

I remember the 1980s, when "information revolution"
seemed like a grandiose term

---

![Power looms](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Powerloom_weaving_in_1835.jpg)

Note:
But then again, in the first few years of the industrial revolution,
anybody would have said it was great for producing cloth.

---

# Changes to

* More industries
* Society's structure
* Mind

Notes:
Urbanization

Supernatural: wild/dangerous; cultivator; machine

---

# Scaling cooperation

Notes:
So, can this information revolution apply to
our scaling problem?

Every revolution has involved cooperative technologies

Took centuries

Don't know where this is going, but excited for prospects

---

# 130,000 Packages

![Software package counts](../module-counts.png)

Notes:
20,000 Python contributors

Without hierarchy, law/regulations, marketplace

---

# Cooperation Lab

- Tools
- Techniques
- Attitudes

Notes:
And, in fact, it's happening

---

# Sloppy terminology

* Information technology
* Open-source
* Agile development

---

# More Caveats

- Idealized FOSS
- Not new

> δωρεὰν ἐλάβετε, δωρεὰν δότε.

# Science!

From alchemy to chemistry

---

# Tour the Laboratory

1. Non-ownership
2. Humility
3. Soft Boundaries
4. Critique
5. Diversity
6. Growth
7. Interfaces
8. Encapsulation

Notes:
Iterate, test, improve, publish

Engineering, not science

The question is how these techniques can spread beyond software

# Ownership

- Secrecy

- Legal control

- Prosperity

Notes:
Ownership of ideas is weird

Centuries of patent and copyright makes us think it's normal

Libraries have their own interesting relationship to the
ownership of ideas

---

# Credibility

<img src="http://previews.123rf.com/images/squarelogo/squarelogo1207/squarelogo120700055/14651230-Vintage-Top-Secret-Recipe-Stock-Vector-shield.jpg" height="200" alt="Secret Recipe" />

Secret == Valuable == Good

Notes:
Tom Sawyer pitch

And yet, the idea has been so long ground in that now we
take it as a credential

---

# Openness is valuable

- Trust
- Credentials
- Cooperation

Notes:
But there's another way to gain credibility, and it's gaining traction.

Don't trust me.  See for yourself.

In the end, chemistry is more credible than alchemy.

---

# Version Control

Tool of non-ownership

- Contribute
- Discuss
- Evolve
- Credit

[prose.io](http://prose.io): versioned text

Notes:
Version control lets us cooperate with all these

Publishing with version-control hosts like Github makes
open the default

---

## Non-ownership outside software

- [Open Hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/)
- [Open Music](http://open-music.org/#principles)
- [wikihouse](https://wikihouse.cc/)
- [Open Beer](http://www.brewtarget.org/)
- [more](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/08/seven-ways-to-use-github-that-arent-coding)

Notes:
Can this go beyond software?  Early experiments are already underway.

---

## Openness in government

- [18F Open Source Policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md)

- [USDS Playbook: Default to Open](https://playbook.cio.gov/)

- [data.gov](http://www.data.gov/)

- FOIA [Release to One, Release to All](http://www.pogo.org/blog/2015/07/foia-release-one-to-all.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/)

- [not all is rosy](https://twitter.com/govtrack/status/849766205690978305)

Notes:
I hope that you are acting similarly in your own libraries
and other institutions.  Think about how to make your work
more visible, more point-at-able.

---

1. Non-ownership
2. **Humility** <<<
3. Soft Boundaries
4. Critique
5. Diversity
6. Growth
7. Interfaces
8. Encapsulation

---

## Optics

Illusion of perfection

- Emotion

- Salesmanship

Notes:
Which is best understood by considering its opposite.

Business intimidation, public intimidation

---

## Humility

- No sweeping under rug

- Seek & acknowledge help

- Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

- Fail fast

- Get feedback

- Iterate: humility about future

Notes:
Nobody ever believed the claims to perfection anyway

---

## [PyOhio 2008](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/centraloh/2008-March/000082.html)

- public library
- bare-bones
- appeal for help

Notes:
How does it work beyond software?

I told you this was my claim to fame.

Fail fast: March to July

## Opposite of

- Insiders / outsiders

- [Groupthink](http://www.psysr.org/about/pubs_resources/groupthink%20overview.htm)

- Hoarding credit

- Not-invented-here

Notes:
We have a tribal instinct.  We know, like, trust our circle.

In FOSS, outside contribution is the brass ring.

A cooperative effort like this is a great example.

---

1. Non-ownership
2. Humility
3. Soft Boundaries
4. **Critique** <<<
5. Diversity
6. Growth
7. Interfaces
8. Encapsulation

---

## Defensiveness

Fear of discrediting

- Emotional

- Economic

---

## Critique is cooperation

- Code review

- Bug reports

- Tests

Part of iteration

Notes:
FOSS experience has proven critique is better than just OK.

Bug reports are volunteer QA.

Tests

And, of course, we're discovering this centuries after scientists did.

---

- Critique never ends
- Critique without limits

---

## Personal

Bug reports on *us*?

Notes:
Be aggressive project managers

Afraid to give or receive advice

Moonshot

## Ask RogueLynn

[Bad news](http://www.roguelynn.com/words/were-not-done-yet/#why-it39s-a-problem)

[Good news](http://www.roguelynn.com/words/were-not-done-yet/#bullshit-excuse-1)

[Plain words](http://www.roguelynn.com/words/were-not-done-yet/#bullshit-excuse-1)

Notes:
Diversity critique is critique, and generates defensiveness and pushback

Moral judgement

This is no time for the software world to congratulate itself.

FOSS community is better, but that's damning with faint praise.

Soft boundaries: delegating to Lynn Root

## Bug reports on diversity

![WONTFIX, not malicious]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pyohio2015/not_malicious.png)

![WONTFIX, not only]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pyohio2015/not_only.png)

Notes:
This would not only make us jerks, it would make us failures.

---

- Gender
- Race
- Age
- Religion
- Disability
- Background

Notes:
So much more than gender

Exhausted?  Despair?

---

# Tests

"Software that is not tested is broken."

Notes:
Programs to test your programs

Verify that they work as you hoped
and that they *keep* working

---

## Rich test suite

    $ ls tests/diversity/
    test_age.py           test_gsm.py
    test_background.py    test_immigrant.py
    test_disability.py	  test_racial.py
    test_gender.py        test_religion.py

Notes:
Tests are part of the program.  Maybe the most important part.
The part that ensures the quality and the value of the program.
A systematic way of explaining what we want and verifying that we have it.

A rich test suite is an asset.  A step toward better software.

So a new type of diversity to value is not a burden.

## Location, partnership

## You got this

- Diverse userbase
- Diverse locations

Notes:
Partnerships!  Libraries have deep roots in all sorts of communities.
Who can you link your folks to?

Notes:
"Pay your dues"

"RTFM"

## Growth == richness

Notes:
When ideas are shared, the more the better

---

## Valuing beginners

Notes:
Don't waste your ignorance!

## Proprietary over-scoping

Big Promises == Big Sales

No need for interfaces!

---

## Small sharp Tools

... that *interface well*

- No control
- No prediction

    history | awk '{a[$2]++}END{for(i in a) \
    {print a[i] " " i}}' | sort -rn | head

FOSS will change the world.

Software will be the least important
part of this change.
